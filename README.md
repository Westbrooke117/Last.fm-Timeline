# Last.fm Timeline
An interactive tool to view your last.fm listening history month-by-month.

## Current Features 📒
- Export album grids or other components as images
- Create a "mini timeline" summary of the user's year on last.fm
- View a 4x4 grid of album covers for each month of the year
- Select any year to view from 2002 to now for any user
- Lazy loading for images to prevent delayed image loading

## Future Features 📝
- Add a share button to share content to social media
- Add support for custom album grid size (at cost of slower speeds)
- More themes for mini timeline

## Current Known Bugs 🐞
- Form error messages appearing after the timeline has loaded causes it to shift downward slightly
- Rarely images will not load
