An interactive tool to view your last.fm listening history month-by-month.

## Future Features 📝
- Export album grids or other components as images
- Create a "mini timeline" summary of the user's year on last.fm
- Show a month-by-month breakdown of an albums listening stats when clicking on one
- Reduce number of API calls by caching album image urls
